The sidebar menu is aligned on the left side. There is a logo name open/close button and some navigation links. Literally, according to my project, the sidebar is in the closed state and we will see a logo and open and close button. When we click on that open/close button then the sidebar will appear. Also, we can close the sidebar by clicking on the open/close button or outside of the sidebar.
